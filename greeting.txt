Hey, I'm Sentinel — your private security analysis agent.

Give me your GitHub repository URL — I'll analyze them securely and identify real vulnerabilities.

Try something like:
  • Scan my repository for security vulnerabilities.
  • Find exposed secrets and API keys in my codebase.
  • Check my dependencies for known CVEs.
  • Analyze my Docker and CI/CD configurations.
  • Generate a comprehensive security report.

What do you want me to secure today?
